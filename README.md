# Hi, I'm Hanxiao 👋

I work in Credit Risk and Data Analytics in the financial industry, specializing in:
- Credit underwriting strategy and line assignment
- Data analysis and performance evaluation
- Cross-functional implementation with Engineering, Modeling, and vendors
- Testing and validating production changes across UI, scoring, and data pipelines

## About this GitHub
Most of my work is proprietary, so this GitHub highlights personal projects created for experimentation and learning. 
These use different technologies than my day-to-day credit-risk work (which focuses on SQL and Python).  
Tasket77, for example, is an exploratory personal project built to solve a workflow challenge I encountered in my day-to-day work, using AI copilots to accelerate the development process.

## Featured Project
**Tasket77** – A lightweight task management tool designed to reduce workflow friction.  
Built with JavaScript as a learning and productivity experiment.
